			<p class="post-body">

			Picture this … you’re at work in a meeting and you suddenly feel like you’ve wet yourself. Oh no, that’s just you’re period. You realise you don’t have any tampons to hand so now you either have to pay £3.00 for a cheaply-made (probably 20 years old) tampon from the work bathroom or make a makeshift pad out of loo roll. As the hours drag on and you start to feel uncomfortable in your own skin, you’re suddenly annoyed by every little thing your boss is asking you to do. Oh, the glamorous life of being a woman.

			<br><br>

			With every month that comes, your period pays a visit bringing its usual gifts: tiredness, bad skin and the occasional evening of crying over nothing. As almost all women who have periods will know, the 5 to 7 days of menstruation isn’t enjoyable but at least we know that it’s only going to last around a week. However, for some women, bad skin and bloating is only a fraction of what their periods can bring.

			<br><br>

			Periods can get very expensive very quickly and we’re not just talking about buying a bunch of tampons. If your period is heavy, if your mood is low, if your stomach cramps are intense, some women are forced by their own biology to take time off work. As if women weren’t already facing inequality at work.

			<br><br>

			Currently, taking menstrual leave is not a popular concept in the UK with only a handful of companies offering paid time off for women who suffer the most. Is this because periods are just too much information?

			<br><br>

			One of the companies that have joined in on this feminist movement is Coexist, a Bristol-based social community group that employs 13 menstruating staff members. Coexist was the first organisation in the UK to acknowledge the period policy which allows employed women to work flexibly when they have their period. This policy was introduced into the workplace to not only allow women to work more comfortably when they’re menstruating but to also recognise the pain that some women suffer whilst on their period.

			<br><br>

			Ruth Keenan, an employee at Coexist said, “Our company has witnessed a number of women who suffer significantly whilst at work during their period. This led Bex Baxter, our former director, who herself had suffered from dysmenorrhea for over 25 years, to create a scheme which is the menstrual policy to support menstruating staff.”

			<br><br>

			This scheme proved to be a success at Coexist as out of the 13 staff members that suffer from periods, 7 women have taken paid time off work each month. “The policy allows up to one day paid leave per month for menstruating staff,” Ruth added.

			<br><br>

			However, this period policy isn’t a reality for most companies. A study has revealed that 86% of women in the UK have started their period at work without having any feminine products on them. Does this ring a bell for you?

			<br><br>

			Vanda Sersikova, a student studying at Bath University suffers intensely from her periods, “I usually spend around £10 per month just on sanitary products, mainly sanitary pads because tampons make me feel unwell. However, pads are more expensive.”

			<br><br>

			Every woman suffers differently with her periods; some are lucky enough to swim through them whilst others drown in self-loathing. As all women who use contraception will know, the pill can have a negative impact on your period (but at least you’re not pregnant).

			<br><br>

			“When I came off my pill, my periods in the first two months were terrible. I was forced to miss university because I was feeling sick and very unconfident. I’m very self-conscious when I’m on my period as when it’s at its heaviest, I’m running to the loo every five minutes,” Vanda added.

			<br><br>

			Vanda’s tone swiftly switched from self-pity to anger, “I think tampons should definitely be free. It’s not a choice to have a period and sanitary products should be available to everyone and they definitely shouldn’t be priced as luxury items.”

			<br><br>

			In order to break down the taboo that surrounds a woman’s period, we need to take action. Introducing the period policy to companies around the UK will prevent women from shying away from their biology and cursing their gender. The period policy will educate others and finally start the conversation for all womankind.
