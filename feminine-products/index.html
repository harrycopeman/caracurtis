			<h1 class="post-header">Why feminine products should be free</h1>

			<p class="post-body">

			The question is: why aren’t feminine products free? Tampons are a necessity, not a luxury.

			<br><br>

			It comes as no surprise that most girls and women around the world have periods. Even though we live in the era of oversharing, menstruating is still treated like a dirty little secret. It’s time to break through the taboo.

			<br><br>

			Menstruation for most women is just an inconvenience that can make them reschedule their hot date, cry for no reason or breath a sigh of relief when they can be sure that they didn’t get pregnant this month (phew). However, in many developing countries around the world, menstruation means girls can’t go to school and women can’t go to work. Charities that are striving towards equal rights for all girls and women around the world have prioritised the distribution of feminine hygiene products.

			<br><br>

			Lack of sanitary items also affects the developed world. Feminine hygiene products are treated like a cosmetic and not as health care; like you can compare a red lipstick to a tampon. Although £5 to £10 doesn’t seem like a lot of money to spend on menstruating per month, this quickly adds up to the average women spending £18,450 on their 450 periods that they will have in their lifetime (not including the extra costs of new underwear, chocolate or rom-com movies).

			<br><br>

			This £5 to £10 per month may not leave a dent in everyone’s bank balance, but for a woman living on low income, this is around two hours of work. If this woman has to pay rent, feed a family and simply live, the £5 to £10 (even more if she has daughters) suddenly adds up to more than just loose change you can find in the sofa. With this in mind, it’s important to remember that women are 21% more likely to live in low-income households than men, according to Poverty.org.

			<br><br>

			With the gender pay gap still looming over women in the UK, being a woman is simply hard work. The latest study from TUC revealed that men are still being paid £100 a week more than women and the last time I checked, men don’t have to pay out £18,450 for tampons and pads in their life.

			<br><br>

			However, the conversation about making feminine hygiene products free for women isn’t a new one. In 2015 in London, there was a protest to ‘End The Tampon Tax’. This protest that encouraged many women to ‘free bleed’ outside the Houses of Parliament all started from a Tweet posted by Mollie Simpson.

			<br><br>

			“If you can afford to give boys free condoms you can afford to give girls free tampons, menstruation is a lot harder the refrain from than sex”

			<br><br>

			Mollie’s Tweet quickly went around the internet which invited both positive and negative comments, ‘I faced a lot of backlash initially for how I (unintentionally and unknowingly but still) excluded the trans community from the debate regarding the tampon tax. I didn’t consider an entire demographic of trans and non-binary people who still experienced periods as much as I said ‘girls’ did. I was really apologetic for this,’ Mollie explained.

			<br><br>

			When this Tweet was posted, the then 17-year-old Mollie felt a twinge of regret, ‘Mostly my feeling as my tweet started to go more and more viral was regret. This feeling was only reinforced when I got some criticism for how some people interpreted my tweet was criticising condoms being free when I was only using them to compare to show it was unfair how tampons weren’t.’

			<br><br>

			This Tweet didn’t just face criticism from internet trolls: “Amongst this backlash I was lucky enough to get some really saddening messages from young girls really struggling to afford to be on their periods, and they seemed genuinely happy I’d spread a message about it.”

			<br><br>

			A year later, the government vowed to slowly end the tampon tax and Mollie’s Tweet was a playing part in this: “I look back on it with a little bit of shame and I always blush when it’s brought up but I’m older and wiser now than a rushed, badly thought out tweet I wrote when I was 17 because I was annoyed about getting my period.”

			<br><br>

			Since the protest in 2015, tampon tax in the UK is still happening with the men at the top charging 5% on ‘luxury’ sanitary items. But where is this 5% of tampon tax going?

			<br><br>

			The Observer has revealed that £250,000 of the money raised from the tampon tax would go to Life, a charity that campaigns against abortion. Wouldn’t this money be better spent on a women’s organisation that truly reflects the values of empowering and supporting women to make decisions about their lives? Life is actively restricting women’s choices.

			<br><br>

			Mark Bhagwandin, the Senior Educator and Media Office at Life argued ‘Life believe in the provision of all-around practical support to women in need.  Should women experience difficulty accessing sanitary products then we would support measures to help them.’

			<br><br>

			Meanwhile, condoms, lubricants, sunscreen and nicotine patches are all tax-free because they are deemed as ‘important’ health care items. Really?
