			<p class="post-body">

			In a world where work can be done across all of your devices and it’s getting increasingly harder to switch off and leave work at your desk.

			<br><br>
 
			Less than ten years ago, before we entered the era of oversharing and overworking, bringing your work life home wasn’t as easy as it is today because business was done with pen and paper. Now that almost every job requires a laptop and a smartphone, your office desk stalks your every move. 

			<br><br>
			 
			The smartphone has revolutionised the working world but has incidentally torn holes in our personal lives by being the gateway for work to get in touch with you 24/7. The constant reminder your phone brings you of work being just a click away can take a heavy toll on your mental and emotional wellbeing. Today, people either live to work or work to live. 

			<br><br>
			 
			“Bringing work home adds stress to an already stressful work day and 90% of all diseases are made worse by stress,” said Mary Allen, a Life Coach and author of The Power of Inner Choice.

			<br><br>

			“Did you know even five minutes of intense stress can lower your immune system for the next several hours? If you value your health, give yourself a break. You’ll be more productive during work and you’ll ultimately have more peace of mind too.”

			<br><br>
			 
			A 2016 study by PsycNET quizzed 132 people on their preference between two kinds of time off work: time when they were on call at home and a day completely off work.

			<br><br>
			 
			This study revealed that workers were more tired and frustrated after a day on call “The results demonstrate that non-work hours during which employees are required to remain available for work cannot be considered leisure time because employees’ control over their activities is constrained and their recovery from work is restricted.”

			<br><br>
			 
			The barrier between work and home life is getting significantly weaker as we move forward with technology since smartphones and computers keep us connected even whilst we sleep. A 2011 study from Bowling Green State University revealed that finding the perfect balance between home and work is particularly hard for people who are expected to be reachable out of office times. A 2014 survey from Pew Research Centre revealed that almost half of office workers say email, the internet, and mobile phones have increased the amount of time they work.

			<br><br>

			Finding a work life balance isn’t just down to you. Although it’s easy to blame yourself for having an insecure balance between your desk and home, people should be encouraging their leadership to inspire change in the work place. Ruth Hubbard, a freelance psychotherapist and life coach explained “The reality of most workplaces are that there are fewer staff to do the work and companies are expecting increasingly better results from an already overworked workforce.”

			<br><br>
 
			Since it’s almost effortless to access your work whilst at home, it’s understandably tempting. “The adrenal rush we get from working in our fast-paced society can be addicting. But, forcing ourselves to take our foot off the accelerator and shifting gears delivers dividends,” said Allen. 

			<br><br>
			 
			Research has shown how productivity declines after people work more than 50 hours a week. Doing excessive hours results in stress, sleep deprivation and difficulty with focusing. In the long-run, is it really worth your time?

			<br><br>
			 
			“By giving yourself conscious downtime, you’ll be more energised and productive during your work time.  While you shift your attention away from work, your subconscious can still be working in the background on unresolved issues at work.”

			<br><br>
			 
			“So when you return to work, solutions magically appear.  Creativity and focus will always be sharper when you’ve taken a real rest from work,” said Allen.

			<br><br>
			 
			It’s important to remember what leaving work at work means, it’s anything from bringing stress home to checking emails at the dinner table. It can be difficult to keep your work life from spilling over into your personal life. However, there are small steps you can do to keep the tide at bay. 

			<br><br>
			 
			The most obvious solution (but by no means, the easiest) is to avoid checking work emails during your own time. In 2017, France passed a law allowing employees to ignore work emails during their personal time out of work.

			<br><br>
			 
			Allen explained “Not only is it healthy to give yourself a break, it communicates to loved ones that they’re important.”

			<br><br>
			 
			There is no magic formula to achieve your personal work life balance because we are all unique. Psychotherapist Hubbard explained “We are all different but one of the things I see most in my practice is an underlying disrespect and disconnection for ourselves and our needs.”

			<br><br>
			 
			“Learn to say no. We say yes too often and most of the time, out of guilt or a desire to be perfect. However, this ultimately drains us and makes life less enjoyable. Stop being so hard on yourself, perfection is an illusion.”

			<br><br>
			 
			Allen shared her clients methods of finding headspace, “I’ve encouraged clients to consciously transition from work to home life with a ritual that works for them.”

			<br><br>
			 
			“For one physician, she spent 30 minutes in her bedroom before relieving her nanny and jumping into mummy mode. She would nap, read, meditate or just rest.  This allowed her to be more present for her 8 year old daughter and her husband.” 

			<br><br>
			 
			Allen added “Having a transition from work to home helps more than you might think. It could be yoga, meditation, a workout at the gym or even a chat with a good friend can help queue your brain to relax.”

			<br><br>
			 
			Allow yourself to check in on work when it’s only convenient for you so no more email responses during dinner. Alternatively, do the opposite and set downtime for just you completely stress-free. This could be anything from meditation to reading - your personal time is your oyster.
