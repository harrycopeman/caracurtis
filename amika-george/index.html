			<h1 class="post-header">Meet the teenager fighting period poverty</h1>

			<p class="post-body">It’s not often that we rely upon 18-year-olds to change the world. Amika George is the face behind the #FreePeriod campaign and after gathering almost 85,000 change.org signatures. George is single-handedly fighting for teenage girls to be given the basic right to free feminine products after learning that 49% of girls have missed a full day of school because of their period.

			<br><br>

			This schoolgirl by day and activist by night took action to break the silence which surrounds period poverty back in March, “after reading a report which revealed that there were girls across the UK who living in such abject levels of poverty that they couldn’t afford menstrual products during their period,” George explained.

			<br><br>

			‘Freedom4Girls’ was asked to divert sanitary supplies from Kenya to a school in Leeds after teachers started to notice patterns in absences. “I was totally bewildered reading this because although I’d read previously that period poverty was prevalent in developing countries, I had absolutely no idea that girls as young as 10 were missing school because they weren’t able to access protection.”

			<br><br>

			“It seemed so wrong to me that there were children creating almost primitive, makeshift solutions such as socks stuffed with wads of toilet paper, or newspaper and I was disgusted that no help was being given to them,” George added.

			<br><br>

			Period Poverty is a term used to describe a lack of access to sanitary items and is known to affect most of the undeveloped world. However, even today, more and more girls in the UK are struggling to afford feminine products and therefore are routinely skipping school. “These children would face enormous anxiety while sitting in lessons, fearful that they’d bled onto their uniform, so the easiest solution was often to miss school,” George explained.

			<br><br>

			“These girls are missing out on their future all because they get a period. It’s wrong and it’s unfair,” George added.

			<br><br>

			This sparked something in George and instead of firing off an angry Tweet, she decided to take real action. In April, George had created the campaign #FreePeriods which urges the UK Government to make a statutory pledge to end period poverty by providing free menstrual products to all girls in the UK on free school meals.

			<br><br>

			‘I wanted to prompt the government into taking action by making sure that everyone knows about the injustice of period poverty,’ George explained.

			<br><br>

			The campaign has not only attracted thousands of signatures, it has also caught the attention of MPs, including Labour’s Jess Phillips and the Liberal Democrats’ Sarah Olney. The Green Party, Women’s Equality Party and the Liberal Democrats have all included a pledge to end period poverty in their manifestos, whilst Labour promised £10m to provide free feminine products in colleges, schools and university across the UK.

			<br><br>

			George isn’t just hoping to spark a political change, she is also fighting the taboo which surrounds menstruation. “The taboo is still very much there,” she says. “I still see so many red-faces when I mention the word, ‘period’ and hasty changes of subject,” George explained.

			<br><br>

			“After starting and continually being so involved in this movement, people are definitely more open to talking about menstruation, and about issues which perhaps 10yrs ago were off limits,” George added.

			<br><br>

			After speaking with George it’s easy to forget that she herself is an 18-year-old at school. Whilst running an important campaign for all girls and women, George is studying for A-level finals, “It’s hard to balance! A-Levels are really demanding, and there’s a lot of pressure with essays, applying to unis, exams, mocks, you name it!”

			<br><br>

			“I spend my evenings doing interviews, writing for publications, writing to MPs and strategising. It’s all necessary, and I never find it a chore, because when one girl contacts me to say they now have hope that they don’t have to suffer the indignity of period poverty anymore, it spurs me on!”
